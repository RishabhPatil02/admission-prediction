"My goal is to combine my background in physics and mathematics with experimental neuroscience to build quantitative models of how brains work. As a child, I fell in love with mathematical problem-solving but it was not until college that I knew what to do with that love. I considered several majors in my first few semesters at USC, but my persistent question - yes, but how does that work?  eventually led me to the physics department and an electricity and magnetism course with Dr. Paolo Zanardi. Using the mathematical problem-solving that I reveled in, we explored the physical mechanisms behind magnets, sunsets, and a wealth of fascinating natural phenomena. The uncompromising inquisitiveness of physics resonated with my own curiosity, and I was hooked.

I became especially interested in the physical basis of information processing and joined Dr. Zanardis Quantum Information Theory group in Torino, Italy the following summer under a USC Provost Research Fellowship. Through calculations and simulations, we sought to define an appropriate concept of thermal equilibrium in quantum mechanics. I learned a great deal about milking mathematical models and simulations for physical results, but most importantly, the excitement of constructing a new theory convinced me that I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing science. Combined with a desire to inspire other students as Dr. Zanardi had done for me, I knew then I wanted to become a professor.

It struck me that while I and other researchers grappled with the fundamental limits of computation, we still lacked a deep understanding of the very information processor that enabled us to do so  the human brain. When I thought about math, which neurons fired? How were the things I learn embodied in my brain? Was it possible to understand the physical basis of the human mind just as we understand a magnet or sunset? I searched for a neuroscience group at USC who might have need of a physicist and soon found Dr. Ted Bergers group, who were having an issue with their simulations of neural synapses. Their numerical integration algorithm was having trouble with the multiple timescales present in biological dynamics, and I discovered the source of this difficulty and proposed an adaptive algorithm to significantly speed up simulations. I also assisted a graduate student in building compartmental models of hippocampal neurons, gaining valuable experience in using the simulation package NEURON. Trading lessons in differential equations for explanations of AMPA dynamics, I also rapidly expanded my budding knowledge of modern neuroscience. Working with the Berger group confirmed to me that (1) it was indeed possible to understand the physical basis of the brain, (2) a background in physics and mathematics was quite useful in doing so, and (3) seeking to understand the biophysical mechanisms of neural computation was exactly the science I wanted to do."
"The doctoral program will provide me with an opportunity to learn more about higher education and prepare me to be a senior level college administrator. I have had several educational and life fulfilling opportunities to work with many administrators to help contribute to the field. Do to the nature of this program; I believe it will provide me with an opportunity to continue to be a catalyst not only within higher education, but my community as well. In addition, this program will help me further my understanding of first generation African American college students expectations and knowledge about college prior to enrolling in the their respective institutions by participating in pre-college programs.

My professional goals are to learn as much as I can about higher education that would strengthen my awareness about trends within the field and how I can contribute to the overall mission and purpose of the profession. I would like to someday become a dean of students or vice president for student services or student affairs as well as a faculty member. I believe my past and current experiences have prepared me tremendously to serve as a senior level administrator.

As a graduate student at American Justice University (AJU), I studied and worked in a number of capacities i.e. graduate assistant, supervisor, advisor, and practitioner within an urban environment. Located in Detroit, AJU challenged me to think critically and provided me with skills to work with a number of different cultures, lifestyle, beliefs, and backgrounds. Classes such as College Student Development, Higher Education Law, Finance, and Administration, and my study abroard experience to England, Scotland, and Ireland deepened my understanding of the field and how colleges and universities operate. These experiences provided me with an opportunity to enhance my understanding of higher education and how to apply theory to practice.

As an active member within a number of different organizations that work to improve the lives of others, I believe I have not only been a catalyst for change, but have instilled a sense of hope for many students. Currently, I serve as an advisor to the Gamma Club (GC) of Detroit, Michigan, which is a youth auxiliary of Beta Beta Beta Sorority, Inc. This youth auxiliary was established in 1970 and designed to assist young females between the ages of 8  18 providing them with opportunities to work with college and professional women on a regular basis, exposing sorority national programs and services, and preparing them for academic and career success. Many of the young women who participate in this program are raised by single parents/guardians (predominately women); therefore, my colleagues and I work extremely hard to ensure these students are provided with the necessary skills to be successful and influenced by positive female role models.

In addition, I serve as a committee member for the MLK Weekend Celebration in Detroit, Michigan. Last year, the committee implemented an essay competition to encourage high school students to think critically and display their creative writing abilities. With access to college becoming more burdensome and stressful for many college students, I worked with university officials at NASPA University, which is located in Denver, Colorado to establish a scholarship (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship) for the first, second, and third place winners of the essay competition. The university agreed to support this initiative to help offset costs during their first semester of study at the university.

In my current role as a Residence Hall Director at NASPA University, I strive to educate the campus community about diversity, multiculturalism, and inclusion, and how it plays an essential role within our society. Part of my responsibility includes monitoring minority students academic and career success and preparing them for graduate or professional schools through the Graduate Recruitment Program (GRP). As advisor to GRP, I believe I have been influential in empowering these students through seminars, workshops, and programs that encourages them to continue to seek higher education.

I believe my experiences have greatly prepared me for the EdD program at NASPAUniversity. I am confident that this program will continue to enhance my understanding of higher education and prepare me to help my colleagues and future colleagues to be catalyst within the profession."
"Growing up, I always loved math and sciences. I was that weird kid that liked calculus and algebra, and I thought that chemistry was fun. And because I excelled in those things, my Aunt Gin always told me: Kinsey, the best way to use those interests and apply them to a career, is to pursue a profession in the healthcare field. So by the end of high school and throughout my college education at University of California Santa Theresa I took coursework intended to prepare myself for paramedical profession. After working for several years for California Fidelity, an insurance company, where I was a medical claims investigator, I realized that Aunt Gin was wrong assuming that calculus and algebra was my calling. Suddenly one day after seeing blue cabbage turning red in lemon sauce, I realized that it was the chemistry rather then actuarial tables that was my calling and life-long desire.

Thirty years old, I moved from California to the Midwest to finish my undergraduate degree as a bachelor of science in Professional Chemistry and I enrolled in University of North Indiana (UNI). I am currently second semester Chemistry Graduate Assistant at UNI. I have helped with chemical safety, inventory of chemicals, drying Sodium Chloride, gathering MSDS, preparing solutions, assisting teachers and storeroom assistant. I have assisted with organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, chromatography, and mass spectrometry. I work with the following instruments on a regular basis: Varian 5890 GF/FID, Varian 3800/Saturn 2000 GC/MS with ion trap detector, Varian 666/Hades, Agilent 1100 Series LC/DAD/MS with an ion trap detector and eletrospray ionization, Pastoraleman/GSD great sensing device trainable attachment with chain and collar, Solution Calorimeter, Bomb Calorimeter, FTIR, ATR, ATV, and UV-VIS. I run blanks, prepare standards, run the SPME, change the tanks, perform autotunes, update log books, made SOPs for the instruments, performed troubleshooting on the instruments, shutdown and rebooted the instruments, supervised other students working on them, and made experiments for class by doing research. This is my second semester as a Chemistry Graduate Assistant at GSU and I now supervise and help the other three GAs that we have at Chemistry department at UNI with thier needs and I have 14 hours of classes that I GA. There needs are usually help with run the SPME, change the tanks, perform autotunes, and update log books. Before working as

GA I was a student worker at UNI for two trimesters and a Laboratory Student Aide at MVCC.

I did my undergraduate research on how familiar high school teachers are with the nature of science (NOS). My graduate research is on teaching the nature of science for high school students. I did research class on creating standard operation procedures for the instrumentation at UNI. I created an experiment of using SPME in the GC/MS lab to analyze water samples. I made standards and spiked water individually with different analytes and I reviewed the mass spectrum to look for molecular ions. Molecular ions can be Chromium, for example. Chromium is factor in developmental of children. Therefore Chromium affect is very important. When the students did the lab they are able to find what all of the components were in the sample by doing library searchers. I am looking to do research on detection limits of analytes on the GC/MS, LC/MS and other instruments, chemical ionization and SPME.

Being only an undergraduate student, my professor suggested that I apply to the chemistry graduate program at Flossmore College. I am looking to move forward with my education so that I can be a college professor. I want to be a college professor mainly because I want to continue to do research and teach. I am presenting some of my research on NOS at the FEMLAB meeting in Boston and I co-presented at the conference last year. I am doing a poster presentation at the ACS National Conference in 2011 on the Glass GC is a see though GC. The Glass GS is a see thought glass GS which can basically be seen into. The glass GC is used at UNI to teach students how to use, troubleshoot, and do routine maintenance on the instrument that is exactly like the one the we have in operation. I would like to focus on Physical Chemistry/Analytical Chemistry on the research that i do for my doctorate.

I love being in a laboratory and I will put forth my best effort to succeed in your program. I enjoy working with instrumentation and I love learning and figuring out new things. I have the desire and the will power to complete the program. I am self-motivated and I will keep up on my research without being reminded. I truly enjoy working in the lab and I want to make a difference in chemistry by continuing to do research. When I am in the lab and I figure out something new is what I thrive for. We do live in a changing world, when the old certainties are changing, and we see the emergence of new forces, new influences, and we enter into a time of tremendous uncertainty, but also of great opportunity. Aunt Gin, if she were still alive and did not die of Cancer, would be happy of my choices. I appreciate your consideration for your chemistry program.

"A desire to extend my knowledge and an enthusiasm to solve the demanding problems faced by the industry today, motivated me to pursue Masters in Networking. I believe that my educational background has instilled in me the qualities required to meet the rigor of this demanding course, and subsequently, the profession. I bring along with me a strong grasp of fundamentals in Electronics, unique but relevant work experience, along with a desire to learn, a penchant for teamwork and leadership, and a zest for challenges.

My first biggest decision which set the path for my career was choosing Electrical Engineering as my field of study even though my parents were against it. Being the owner of a manufacturing company in the FMCG industry; I remember the day I and my father had an argument about what I should do with my life. While he wanted me to pursue Business Management, I always had a desire to know how things work, wanted to learn by experience & yearned to solve challenging problems. Ever since the day my father brought our first television set home, I have had a peculiar interest in knowing how one could fit an entire world into such a small box. A few other insanely inquisitive questions led me to choose to study Electrical Engineering, and I still believe that it is the smartest thing I have ever done.

I am deeply inspired & motivated by my professor Dr. Rama Chandran, who is very well known in the country for his contributions to the Department of Telecommunications, Government of India., Upon his advice, I decided to pursue, and thereby developed an interest in Networking during my third year. The courses Computer Networks and High Speed Networks coupled with my summer internship at Vodafone, where I handled Routers and Servers, made me realize how much interested I am in Networking. Consequently, I chose to specialize in Networking. My interest further aligned me to design a Bluetooth Personal Area Network for controlling and monitoring the functioning of all the devices connected to the same network. Towards this, I chose to take TCP/IP Networking and Network Security and Cryptography as part of my coursework during my fourth year. My interest in these courses reflected in my GPA, standing at 9.6 on a scale of 10 in these subjects. I also began increasing my cognizance about Computer Networks by collecting information from the internet and reading research papers which soon turned into a passion for me.


I also worked on two projects during my third year. The first was Bluetooth using LABView where I led a team of seven students. We used LABVIEW Bluetooth module to control and transfer data from one device to another by varying the quarter wave antenna length thereby increasing the range of the Bluetooth device. Although the increase in the range compared to the battery consumption was not commercially viable, we were successful in increasing the usage range of the Bluetooth device.

Based on my interest towards networking, I was placed in one of the largest telecommunication companies in my state, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, to undergo a very prestigious

internship program which allowed me to work in the company for the entire summer. A study on the company and its products, introduced to me the importance of providing innovative solutions to satisfy the needs of the industry. I concluded from my findings that in India, communication is relatively cheap and effective, and also is an ever growing demand, but faces massive operational, infrastructural, and logistical challenges. I hence worked on optimizing PSTN Routing by determining the most cost effective way to route calls, which was lauded by my mentor engineers in the company, and was implemented immediately. This gave me valuable insights into how companies operate, the necessity of good organizational structures and the significance of well-designed equipment and strategy.

In the near future, I see myself working in the Research & Development department of a reputed company where I would get an opportunity to solve some of the major challenges of the industry. I seriously consider pursuing a Doctoral Program (PhD) at a later stage, in order to further my knowledge of the industry. Towards this, I chose to pursue Masters in Computer Networks from the A.B.C College of Engineering and Computer Science - Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Example, primarily because the schools strength lies in Networking and Cybersecurity, which closely commensurates my research interests and, hence would help me achieve my career goals.

Furthermore, I am particularly interested in Professor Peter K. Mourinhos work and believe that his contribution to multiband cognitive radio networks will be vital in the years to come. Also, his work is in line with my interests and current training level, making it an ideal choice for me. I will be more than honored if I can earn a spot in his next research group. The well reputed course, experienced faculty and world class facilities are an added advantage. I would fully utilize the resources that the Wallenberg Hall provides, as I am particularly interested in the field of Networking. The special 24/7 laboratories provided for student research on Routers and Signal Processing is exactly the kind of opportunity I am looking for, as I could totally see myself working in the labs day and night. I also believe that my experience coupled with thorough enthusiasm for research would make me a candidate for a Research Assistantship at your institution.

I have always believed in giving something back to the society. I remember my mother telling me that helping others is the rent we have to pay for living on this wonderful planet. That statement had a profound impact on me, and since that day, I have never turned down an opportunity to pay it forward. Apart from little acts of kindness from childhood, I recently joined English for Everyone (NGO) where I have been teaching the English Curriculum developed by Oxford University to 30 economically backward kids for the past year and a half. Though I joined as a teaching volunteer during the weekends, with constant enthusiasm and efforts, I have been able to make an impact on the way my class learns, and I consequently became the mentor of my batch of 30 volunteers, who teach to over 600 children. Given my experience in teaching, and an unquenchable thirst for Networking, a Teaching Assistantship position at your institution would certainly further my interest and skills, ahead of my future career objectives.

I sincerely hope that I qualify all the requirements for admission into your Graduate Program and that my application is favorably received by the admissions committee."
"As a child born and raised in Delhi, India, I never questioned the idea of my present life being a reflection of my actions from past lifetimes. The ideology of karma, endemic to Indian society, emphasizes that everything in our lives  from the amount of wealth we possess to the sickness we suffer from  is a consequence of our prior actions. However, I began to question/doubt this belief when I chose a biology-focused curriculum in high school and learned about inherited traits, gene function, expression and regulation. Is sickness really an outcome of karma? In the battle between genes and karma, who wins the right to determine a persons fate? Or is fate a culmination of both karmic and genetic influences? In the case of identical twins, what dictates which one of the two battles cancer and which one will struggle to survive calculus? If it is purely genetic, then what factors are responsible for these life-transforming differences? What genes and pathways are being affected? At what stage of development are these genes being turned on or off? My desire to answers these questions furthered my desire to pursue biology in college so I could better understand the mechanisms that regulate DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis; how this varies in different organisms and how it relates to human diseases.

At Ohio Wesleyan University (OWU) I have engaged in rigorous coursework in zoology and botany, and also in physics, chemistry, philosophy, humanities, mathematics and psychology. As a freshman, I enrolled in a Plant Signal Transduction honors research tutorial that focused on fundamental molecular mechanisms that govern a plants response to its environment. I assisted an upperclassman with data collection and eventually assumed responsibility for the project, thus reinforcing my conviction and desire to pursue research in biological sciences. The undergraduate courses and associated lab work have enabled me to master a variety of techniques such as plasmid purification, transfection, northern blots, HPLC, NMR, growth media and buffer preparations etc. I have used many of these skills in other research projects that I have been involved in throughout my undergraduate career.

In my junior year, I worked in Dr. Danielle Hamills lab on a project that focused on studying cell division and early developmental processes particularly in Caenorhabditis elegans. We characterized cell division mutants using molecular and genetic analyses to investigate the parental contributions to this phenotype. Since the process of cell division is highly conserved across most organisms, this study will help understand this process in other similar organisms as well. Though I began with a basic understanding of the project, reading journal articles throughout the year increased my knowledge of developmental processes (signaling mechanisms) and also helped me overcome several experimental problems that we encountered. This project required me to use several advanced microscopy techniques, such as confocal,
 

fluorescence and DIC to visualize whole worms, dividing embryos, spindle formation in cells etc.

For the past two summers, I have contributed to a research project in Dr. Chris Wolvertons lab. Our goal has been to examine the relationship between Phosphate (Pi) availability and lateral root gravitropism by quantitatively studying the effects of low Pi concentrations on lateral root architecture of wild-type (WT) and mutants PHT1:1 and PHT1:4 (Pi transporter genes) seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. In previous studies we observed that WT seedlings grown on low-Pi medium exhibited an increased gravitropic response. Our results were consistent with our hypothesis that the gravitropic response of both mutants grown in normal Pi medium will be similar to that of WT seedlings grown in low-Pi medium. Understanding this relationship, will allow us to select for plants that have higher productivity and require fewer fertilizer inputs. As part of the project, I used techniques, such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), RT-PCR, gel electrophoresis, automated image analysis, confocal microscopy, time-lapse photography etc. At the end of summer, I presented a poster at the research symposium, summarizing my results from the 10-week program. I also presented my results in a poster session at the Mid-western section meeting of ASPB (American Society of Plant Biologists). Under the guidance of Dr. Wolverton and a former OWU student, I am currently in the process of finishing up the project and documenting results that will be included in a paper that will be submitted for publication. While these experiences reaffirmed my interest in research, the Cell and Molecular Biology course helped me identify a more focused area of research. This course highlighted questions related to molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic cellular physiology. Some of the topics covered included protein structure and regulation; signal transduction; and cellular mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis. I mastered techniques such as SDS page, Northern blot, Nanodrop and Microplate spectroscopy. A very valuable experience in this class was learning to write an NIH-style grant proposal. While I wasnt able to actually carry out the experiments, I developed a research project that focused on abnormal activation of Wnt signaling pathways and its tumorigenic effects and wrote a grant proposal to examine the interaction between Smo and Ptch proteins in this pathway. In order to design my own experiments and write a thorough and convincing proposal, I read through numerous journal articles that related the concepts we learned in class to current areas of research. Since writing grant proposals will be an integral part of my future career, this training was very useful. The courses focus on signal transduction pathways and tumorigenesis propelled me in the direction of cancer research.

My education and research experience at OWU have prepared me for a graduate program in [insert program name here]. There are many faculty members at _________ University doing research I find fascinating. For example, I am very interested in Dr. Lorainne Santys research on the role of GTPases in epithelial cell mobility and metastasis. The project uses many techniques that I am well acquainted with including Western Blot, transduction and transfection among others. The Santy labs focus on signaling mechanisms affecting cell motility is very
 

much in line with the type of cancer research I would like to do. I want to focus on identifying novel anticancer drug targets by examining cell signaling dysfunctionalities in tumor development and translating these findings into potent therapeutics. My decision to apply to Ph.D. programs stems from my career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the field of translational cancer research. In addition to research, I am committed to having a career that enables me to mentor and lead a group of aspiring graduate level researchers. I believe that the education and opportunities that I will get as a research or teaching assistant will prepare me to successfully fulfill my career goals."
"I am applying to Harvards doctoral program in economics in pursuit of a career in academic research. I entered economics research because I enjoy modeling real-world situations with math. This interest was confirmed by my research work, which included projects on mortgages, optimal surveys, and consumer savings. These research experiences also led me to discover that I enjoy theory work, especially theory fields that see wide use in empirical research, fields like game theory and mechanism design. My interest in game theory and behavioral economics recently led me to explore the subfield of learning in games, in which I have a few research ideas.

I entered economics research because I enjoy the process of modeling social situations, the process of looking at an economic phenomenon, thinking about the key empirical factors, and making the correct variable and structural choices to generate a tractable model that explains the situation. For example, one project I worked on for Professor John Jonson involved finding a formula that gave the best time to refinance mortgages. In this project, I enjoyed contemplating the various tradeoffs between simplicity and richness that went into the model design. Should we model interest rates as mean reverting, or is a simple random walk sufficiently approximate? Should we be precise and model mortgage amortization time, or should we avoid an extra state variable and instead just use a time-stationary hazard rate? These tradeoffs were interesting to think about, and existed in all projects: for example, my work on optimal surveys required careful consideration of response interaction complexity. Overall, my research work confirmed my interest in economic model building.

In doing research work, I also began to discover a new interest in economic theory, especially in theory work that is heavily used by empirical economics. For the mortgage-refinancing project, my major personal contribution was finding a closed-form solution for the refinancing formula. I discovered that I enjoy carefully thinking about the highly mathematical parts of the problem, like the existence conditions for the formulas solutions or the analytic details of the bellman equations. Similarly, I enjoyed the process of finding mathematical insights in my optimal survey project. One insight involved using a multidimensional envelope theorem; another insight involved pushing a standard delta-method technique in statistics to infinite cases. In both project, I was especially satisfied to know that these theoretical results advanced practical goals in empirical research. For mortgage research, a closed-form solution significantly advances the papers goal of providing a simple formula homeowners can use. For optimal survey research, the math insights led to a method of construction of the best survey possible. The method was put to actual use for a separate journal article on empirical intertemporal discount rates. Through all these projects, I both enjoyed generating mathematical insights and knowing that these theoretical advances have real empirical benefits.

My revealed interest in economic theory led me towards theoretical fields with wide applications, fields like game theory and mechanism design where advances in theory increase the power and scope of all of economics. For example, in game theory, sequential equilibrium in extensive form games allows richer dynamic models. In mechanism design, the revelation principle simplifies mechanism

calculations. Implementation theory allows economists to design novel institutions to meet an objective that was previously untenable. The applicability of such theory work appeals greatly to me.

In addition to game theory and mechanism design, behavioural economics also

interests me because of my recent exposure to the field in research assistance

work.  Behavioral economics is appealing because it question the basic assumptions of

rationality in an attempt to generate more accurate predictions about human

behavior.  However, work in behavioural economics often lacks unity.  Instead of a

central model that explains a wide set of phenomena, oftentimes, there are numerous

models that each explain a specific phenomenon without the ability to generalize

further.  For example in the subfield of learning in games, reinforcement models like

Roth and Erev (1995) explain trends in learning, but predicts convergence much too

slowly in coordination games (Boylan and El-Gamal 1992).  In contrast, belief learning

models like Fudenberg and Levine (1998) allow hypothetical reinforcement and hence

faster learning, but performs slightly worse on zero-sum games (Battalio, Samuelson,

and Van Huyck 1997; Mookerjee and Sopher 1997).	Camerer (1999) synthesizes these

two models in an Experience Weighted Attraction (EWA) model, but EWA has a high

number of parameters that vary widely for different games, and still exhibits poor

performance in zero-sum games.  These models predict zero sum games poorly

because they fail to consider a fraction of players who overpredict reinforcement

learning in opponents. The missing component then is having players who are

heterogeneous in level of sophistication, a structure in the style of Nagel (1995) or Stahl

and Wilson (1995).  However, instead of nth order reasoning, the correct concept

seems to be nth order sophistication, an idea that Camerer (2007) broaches with the

Cognitive Hierarchy (CH) model.  CH is a static model however and needs to be

extended to a dynamic setting, perhaps by allowing player sophistication to rise over

time, or by basing the actions of level zero player on historic outcomes as in Stahl

(1996).  This model would explain quick convergence in median action games 

sophisticates jump to the median very rapidly.  This model also explains reinforcement

overprediction in zero-sum games: level-one players number higher than level-zero

players.  If such a theory is confirmed through experiments, it would advance the goal

of having more general models for behavioral economics.

"When I came to college I wanted to be a doctor. I was going to study biology, pick up a second major along the way, and go to medical school to become a rural practitioner. I soon realized that I was suffering from my own version of ""Med. Student Syndrome."" I did not think that I was sick, but I did realize that I was obviously delusional. I realized that I did not have the burning desire to become a medical doctor. The profession did not interest me; it was my perception of the profession that had caught my fancy. Luckily, by then I had begun to study psychology, so I understood what a good delusion was like.

As I studied psychology more and more, I found what excites me most of all were the investigation, dissection and understanding of problems that I saw around me in the world. I found psychology courses stimulated me to think and explore my world as I took courses in development, psychopathology, personality and behavior analysis. Dr. XXXX's behavior analysis classes gave me good critical and analytic skills through our repeated analyses, discussion and practice of both basic and complex behavioral principles.

I received research training with XXX, Ph.D. while working on an autism and social behaviors study, and with XXX, Ph.D. while writing an honors thesis and subsequent poster presentation. My work with Dr. XXX helped me develop my observational skills and learn to classify and define abstract descriptors into concrete variables. In my honors research, I started with a broad question, wondering whether young adults' substance use behaviors were related to both sensation seeking and their friendships and if so how. Once I narrowed my ideas, collected and analyzed the data, I had to deal with the frustration of getting results that did not support the hypotheses. I did more data collection and analyses for a poster presentation at the Society for Prevention Research annual conference, and in post-hoc analyses I found that while I had studied the sample as a whole, males and females had different predictors of alcohol use. Even though I hadn't supported my original hypotheses, this gave me ideas as to why. One of my favorite biology professors used to say that advances in science are often made by proving something does not exist, something I learned well through my research.

I am currently volunteering for a year in Fairbanks, Alaska, through the Jesuit Volunteer Corps at a parenting resource center. I work in Family Preservation Services with families whose children have been in state custody trying to keep the families together. It's difficult work; I see kids every day who are very young but who have already had pretty tough lives. Many of these children could be case studies of multiple risk factors. As some here have put it, they are ""damaged."" My work here has really driven my thinking about how abuse, divorce, and familial discord interact to affect children in their social interactions, their view of themselves and the world, and the future predicted for them.

Through my undergraduate research, including my honors thesis, I was introduced to the issues surrounding adolescent substance use. I found myself very interested in both the specific issues of adolescent substance use and the ideas of how an adolescent's context, whether it is familial, environmental or peer, could affect the adolescent's life. I would like to find ways to help kids like
 

those I work with have more promising lives. I am interested in studying child and adolescent mental health, particularly issues of substance use, risk and resilience, pathology and aggression, and how social and family context affects each of these issues. Essentially I am interested in ways in which we can make growing up less difficult, particularly for high-risk kids.

I see myself spending my career primarily in research and teaching. I see it as crucial to have research that is well informed by clinical practice, and clinical practice well grounded in research. I also see it as necessary to ensure that research is properly disseminated, and that under-served areas gain increased attention as targets of study and clinical practice assistance. For example, most of Alaska does not have a strong university presence, and I believe that the social service programs here suffer from not being up to speed on the latest in clinical developments. I'd like to develop prevention programs and interventions to help address what I choose to specialize in, and a position as a university professor would be the ideal way to achieve this goal. Further, I am very attracted by the prospect of teaching and mentoring college students about what I love.

I decided to apply to XXX University for several reasons. I am attracted to XXX University by the strong emphasis on research and methodology. Particularly, the strong preventive focus of the Child Clinical area of emphasis is one that meshes well with what I am looking for in a program. In researching XXX University, the work of Drs. XXX and XXX particularly piqued my interest. I worked with XXX at XXX University, who exposed me to much of Dr. XXX's work on children of alcoholics. I would be interested in further pursuing work in risk factors for substance abuse, particularly looking at how familial and social context affect risk behaviors. Dr. XXX' research in risk and resilience and her prevention work with high risk adolescents is very much what I am interested in doing, as I not only have research experience but the clinical work with similar populations to what Dr. XXX' is working with.

The Clinical Psychology program at XXX University has everything I am looking for in a program, just as I feel I have what XXX University should be looking for in an incoming student. I would be very excited to join the incoming class at the XXX University for 2000. I feel I am well prepared to enter graduate study, and my strong motivation and career goals are a good match for what XXX has to offer."
"I want to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, and my career aspiration is to become a professor. My research interests include program analysis, software engineering, operating systems, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

My motivation for pursuing research related to program analysis stems from learning about the challenges of software development during 3 summers spent as a software engi-neering intern (1 at Codehost, a start-up, and 2 at Teradyne, a large corporation). Although I found the actual development work to be educational, what really sparked my interest in research was experiencing first-hand the challenges that software engineers face daily.

I aspire to create tools that can increase programmer productivity and improve software quality and security. As a first step towards this goal, for the past 2 years I have been working with Prof. Michael Ernst in the MIT Program Analysis Group. The research problem that my work addresses is the di?culty of building dynamic analysis tools that work reliably on large C and C++ programs, due to the presence of complex constructs and the lack of memory and type safety. I have developed a framework named Fjalar that enables the construction of scalable and robust dynamic analyses for C and C++ programs. It operates on unmodified x86 binaries of programs as large as 1 million lines of code, and it provides rich language- and machine-level information at run time. I have used Fjalar to build two dynamic analysis tools. The first, Kvasir, records a detailed trace of data structure contents during execution. The second, DynComp, performs dynamic type inference to find sets of related variables whose values interact at run time. My Masters thesis is based on Fjalar and the tools built upon it. I also have experience with static analysis. I am currently working on type inference of unit types (e.g., physics units) for C programs.

My research has been directly applied to several projects and produced visible results. Prof. Ernst has used Kvasir to extend the Daikon dynamic invariant detector to analyze large C and C++ programs, and he has used DynComp to improve Daikons performance and the quality of inferred invariants. We collaborated with Prof. Martin Rinard to use Daikon together with Kvasir and DynComp to generate constraints for performing run time data structure repair. This research was funded by DARPA, and they recently evaluated its e?ectiveness by hiring an external company to try to attack and crash a specific program: the Freeciv multiplayer game server. Our repair system successfully protected the server from a high percentage of their attacks. In another assessment, we were able to use this repair system to mitigate the e?ects of several real security flaws in the BIND DNS server. It is very encouraging to see my research applied to real-world problems.

Taking an Operating Systems Engineering course has inspired me to explore OS-related research. In particular, I am interested in applying program analysis to make low-level software such as operating systems more reliable and secure. In addition, I have worked on 2 research projects that have stimulated my interest in user interfaces and HCI: I created a suite of 5 educational games for Palm OS devices for the Teacher Education Program (2002-2003) and an image editing tool for the Computer Graphics Group (Fall 2003).

Although I am open to a variety of research, there are several professors at Stanford whose projects are especially appealing to me: Profs. Aiken, Engler, and Lam (program analysis); Profs. Fox and Mazieres (OS and distributed systems); Prof. Klemmer (HCI). Studying some of these professors papers for classes and for my research and reading project websites have given me a sense that Stanfords Ph.D. program is a great match for my interests."
"Having worked as a teacher at Liaocheng Teachers Institute for two years, I passed the 1989 Postgraduate Examination Test and started to do my masters degree in Linguistics and Applied Linguistics School of Foreign Languages of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This department is a reputable one in China with quite a number of famous scholars specializing in linguistics and applied linguistics. Affiliated to the department is the College English Test Administrative office, which administers the National College English Tests on behalf of the State Education Ministry. I benefited a great deal from the teaching of the professors and also had chances to observe and take part in as well the research activities such as testing.

I was among the best 5 in a class of 15. Unfortunately, my need for self-development in educational psychology was not satisfied owing to the lack of necessary equipment and facilities for doing experiment and collecting data. The lack of the latest collections of books on linguistics, psychology or pedagogy in our library due to the lack of hard currency also affected my systematic research more or less.I was outstanding both at academic courses and extracurricular activities. I was among the best five in a class of 25. I acted as the assistant to the editor-in-chief of the school literary newspaper Xing Tang  when I was a junior and the editor-in-chief when I was a senior."
"In order to best contribute to the leading questions at the frontiers of neuroscience, I am committed to approaching my own research from an interdisciplinary standpoint to arrive at the most innovative approaches and conclusions. For this reason, I am drawn to the Rockefeller University graduate program for its encouragement of multidisciplinary collaborations, and its leading and scientifically diverse faculty. Rockefeller Universitys wide array of strong sensory perception research, including the labs of investigators such as Professors Ruta, Vosshall, and Magnasco offer an excellent fit for my research interests and a range of opportunities to better understand the complex interactions between fields of neuroscience. Through the Rockefeller University graduate programs flexible curriculum, I am also eager to explore my interests in engineering and computer science, and the potential to use these perspectives within neuroscience through continuing my interest in building assays for measuring model organisms behavior and sensory experiences. As a graduate student, I also plan to engage with organizations like the Science Communication and Media Group and WISeR, because public perception of science, on local and global levels, as well as supporting women in the sciences are extremely important causes to me. With a Ph.D. from Rockefeller Universitys graduate program and experience with the exceptional investigators and unique interdisciplinary scientific community at Rockefeller, I will be well prepared to pursue innovative directions in my research and a successful career as a scientist."
"Certainly, my academic journey has not been without various challenges, which explain some of the inconsistencies in my grades. Largely, this is due to the fact that in college, I had to work on a part-time basis in order to cater for some of my expanses. My real academic abilities are reflected in my high school grades, where I managed to secure exemplary grades as my education was not disrupted by any other activity. I have surmounted this problem and strongly believe that I will excel in my academic pursuit at your college, emerging as one of the elites in the field of Urban Design, and with immense positive influence in the society.

In conclusion, I believe that based on my academic ground and past experiences in the field of architecture, when granted the opportunity to advance my studies by pursuing a Masters Degree in Urban Design, I would be of much value to the architectural academic discipline and the Indian economy as well. Precisely, my desires to attain academic excellence in and contribute to this field are reasons to place confidence in my academic pursuit."
"During my early studies I had no clue about architecture. But I knew I wanted to do something creative. My passion for arts was identified by my parents when I was in 5th class. I chose to pursue architecture and joined college of architecture.  I soon realized that learning architecture gives me immense eternal joy and satisfaction. My interest in sketching sceneries is also in line with the study of landscape architecture.  
Landscape architects compose the elements which define space but the overall objective is to design space (or 'create good outdoor places') and to find a balance between beauty, nature and functionality.

Owing to several transfers of my dad, who is working in Bank. I had an opportunity to closely interact with people of different cultures. I learned to adjust myself with the people of different taste, sentiments and cultures. I find myself very comfortable to mix with the people of different cultures.

I remember being told in the second year of B Arch, by one of my teachers 'unless you put a function to your creation - its not architecture, its just visual art. My first realisation of art was through the understanding that emptiness can be a material used by artists like Frank Stella and Bernett Newman as a medium and that the minimalism of Tadao Ando is more complex than complexities of life itself. Books like complexities and contradictions in architecture-Robert Venturi - broadened my horizons by juxtaposing the present, past and future trends in architecture.

In addition to my academic activities, I have also participated in many extra curricular activities events in my Architecture College and received certificates and prizes for Photography competition at the Inter Collegiate Level. This was a distinctively gratifying experience for me, which I feel would stand in good stead in the future.

With the pace for urbanization the free green lands are being use for construction of buildings, roads, bridges, etc. This is decimating the greeneries in cities, particularly in Mumbai, India, the greenery is reducing at a much faster rate. This provides ample of scope for Landscape architects to plan the city, accommodate more space for the greeneries.

My professor also suggested me to choose a landscaping firm for my professional practice after seeing my design folio. I started taking keen interest in learning the minutes of landscape. I realized that my core competence lies in the field of landscaping rather than in any branch of architecture.

My first professional understanding of landscaping architecture was with Ar.Rajoo Pradhan during my professional practice in 4th year. Seeing my keen interest in landscaping he took interest in my learning. He also posed great confidence in me for taking independent assignment while I was a mere trainee. This gave me confidence to sharpen my creativity.

This period has proven to be a learning experience that has added a new dimension to my inter-personal skills and knowledge in the sphere of Landscape architecture and still continues to do so. I believe that my strong background in the Landscape architecture field and have equipped me with the inter-disciplinary skill set to perform such a study. This has helped me to gain exposure, insight and knowledge and hands on experience with the real time work environment.

At college, besides regular studies, it was participating in G-Sen trophy for NASA 1999-2000,held in Mumbai, organizing social events etc. It reinforced my belief in honing my skills and consolidating my confidence. Also during occasional tours across the country organized by my college I had the opportunity to see several architectural wonders of India. Also had the priviledge to have one to conversation about architecture & practice with famous Ar.Anupama Kundoo, Ar.B.V.Doshi, Ar. Kanvinde. These events, tours and participations helped me a lot to gain the concept of working in, with and as a team.

After my graduation in 2002, I joined  xxxx firm (Oct 2002 -May 2003) and then  Landscaping firm (Aug2003-June2004). I learned designing and work scope framing, project planning scheduling, etc. After working with three architects upto 2004, I realized in order to build higher skill and to learn technologies in this field, higher studies in the field of Landscape architecture in International Institute is vital. I quit the company and started preparing for GRE and TOEFL exams. 

Then I started exploring in net for university of International repute in the field of Landscape architecture for my Masters degree. After due search, I could know about your esteemed university and convinced after reading your brochure that your university would be a right destination for pursuing my masters in Landscaping. The size and diversity of the highly qualified faculty, nature of courses offered, truly State-of-The art Infrastructure and the chance to interact with distinguished and learned professionals have influenced my decision to apply to your university.

Finally, I decided to pursue my Masters degree in Landscape architecture at your esteemed university. 

I am applying to your University after viewing the course curriculum provided by your University. As the research focus and facilities available in your department complement my research interests and requirements, I believe that being a part of your department would not only enhance my career opportunities, but also help me realize my maximum potential. Thus, I feel that as a Masters student at your department, I can avail 
myself numerous exciting opportunities.

I look to pursue Masters study to upgrade my knowledge and skills in my areas of interest. I believe it will also serve to give direction to my career goal as a Landscape professional at an academic or commercial, research-oriented organization. I intend to pursue a Masters in Landscape architecture in order to reach that goal.

As I evolve as a student of architecture I feel the need to know more. Hence I wish to dive deeper into the process of creating.

In conclusion, I find that your University offers the pre-requisites needed to achieve my goals in life. The work experience, research or training that I will acquire during the course of this program will help me to get a head start in my career and it is this magnetism that has attracted me to your University. I feel confident that my background would help me make the most of our program and unleash my true potential essential. I look forward to being a strong addition to your department. I hope that this brief statement has given you a better idea of my abilities, experience and interests. I am very confident that if I get an opportunity to be a part of that intellectually stimulating environment, I am sure that my talents will be put to optimal use."
"I am interested in the STRATFOR summer internship program because it will give me invaluable experience in world affairs and intelligence analysis that will benefit me as I pursue a career in the United States Foreign Service or in government intelligence agencies. I also believe that my experience and skills will be an asset to STRATFOR during my internship.

I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Chicago, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in East Asian Languages and Civilizations with an emphasis on China. I have been studying Mandarin Chinese for five years, including two trips to Beijing on scholarship. The first was for intensive language study, while the second was to carry out an independent research project which I designed for my senior bachelors thesis. Through this project, which involved interviewing witnesses of Chinese political criticism in the 1950s, I learned how to research a subject in a comprehensive way. This same skill would be an asset as I assist in constructing intelligence analyses with STRATFOR.

I am currently a Masters candidate at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center for Chinese and American Studies in Nanjing, China, where I am studying International Politics. This has given me a great deal of knowledge in modern global affairs and international relations, in addition to background knowledge of the East Asian region specifically. In particular, I have studied Sino-US economic and political relations, the modern Chinese conception of national security, and Chinese viewpoints on important issues such as the Taiwan question. This has given me a sense of where East Asian and world affairs are likely heading in the future, and would make me invaluable as an analyst in a number of Areas of Responsibility, including East Asia, Military, and Terrorism/Security.

Outside of the classroom, I have been a leader in my community. At the University of Chicago, I was president of the Inter-House Council, an organization that advises the University administration on student life issues. This role required me to work with community stakeholders in a constructive fashion and plan with them in mind. For example, I served as the chair of a committee that formulated and instituted a plan to create gender neutral housing at the University, in order to benefit those who may not feel comfortable in traditional housing. In doing so, we needed to account for the concerns of first year students, administrators, and many other groups. I also served as a technical support advisor at a Chicago public school, work for which I received an award. This has both given me a great deal of proficiency both in working with technology and in interacting with people very different from myself. The organizational and technical skills that I have acquired from these experiences have given me a great deal of self motivation and leadership skill. In STRATFORs fast paced environment of daily analysis, these skills will keep me focused on producing the best work possible.

In sum, I believe that my education and leadership experiences would benefit STRATFOR considerably were I to be selected for an internship. At the same time, interning at STRATFOR would jumpstart my career in the public sector and prepare me for possible private sector work as an intelligence analyst. I hope to discuss this exciting opportunity with you further."
"Currently, I am working with USC Professor Bartlett Mel to understand how brains rapidly and robustly encode information presented only once. In particular, we are investigating the optimal dendrite morphology for memory capacity during one-shot learning tasks and studying how the optimal morphology varies with input features such as noise and density of activation. We hypothesize that dendrite morphology is optimized to shift response variability to a regime efficient for memory capacity. We are also exploring various definitions of memory capacity and the connections between them. One of Dr. Mels students has amassed a collection of simulation data, and my role is to build mathematical models that help explain his results, enable analytic calculations of memory capacity, and suggest new simulations to further refine our hypotheses. Our hope is that the optimal biophysical variables we identify will correspond with experimental values in the brain. Our approach is characteristic of what I believe is a unique and important contribution that physics and mathematics may offer biology  explanations for the functional role of biological mechanisms rooted in arguments for their optimality.

My strategy of pursuing research in both physics and neuroscience has provided me with unique insights into the brain, valuable experience with interdisciplinary collaborations, and clarity on my career goals. I would like to pursue a Ph.D. followed by a professorship to continue my research and share my passion for discovery with eager young minds. Through collaborations with experimentalists and my training in physics and mathematics, I want to explore the links between biophysical mechanisms and their functional roles in neural computation. In addition to my research, I have pursued and excelled in several graduate courses in physics and mathematics and even picked up new analytic tools from other graduate departments, such as information theory and mathematical optimization. Concurrently, I have attained a significant knowledge of modern neuroscience through extracurricular study and research. Thus I am confident in my choice of graduate research and in my preparation for pursuing it.

Furthermore, I am confident that the University of Washingtons Physics program would be a great place for me to do so. I am attracted by the large community of faculty and students interested in biophysics and particularly interested in working with Drs. Adrienne Fairhall, Fred Rieke, and Eric Shea-Brown, each of whom I have contacted. As I prefer theoretical work closely coupled with ongoing experiments, I am especially interested in a project co-advised by Dr. Rieke and either Dr. Fairhall or Dr. Shea-Brown. Two interests I might pursue with Drs. Fairhall and Rieke are the roles of prediction and online algorithms in vision. In particular, to what extent does the prediction of common input patterns enable the visual system to increase processing speed and reduce energy expenditure, and how do the temporal demands of a visual task affect the processing of neural signals? Another possibility would be to study the interactions of adaptive mechanisms acting on different timescales, a topic on which I have recently submitted an NSF GRFP research proposal (available upon request). With Drs. Shea-Brown and Rieke, on the other hand, I might seek an understanding of single-neuron response variability, exploring the relative contributions due to input statistics, biological constraints, the exploitation of stochastic resonance, and other potential sources. Another potential focus of our collaboration could be the modulatory effect of persistent network activity on single-neuron responses and the role of this modulation in neural computation. Though the research is my main attraction to UW, I would be remiss if I did not mention that I do my best thinking in the outdoors and welcome the opportunity to spend weekends hiking and mountaineering in the environs of Seattle."
"I did my undergraduate research on how familiar high school teachers are with the nature of science (NOS). My graduate research is on teaching the nature of science for high school students. I did research class on creating standard operation procedures for the instrumentation at UNI. I created an experiment of using SPME in the GC/MS lab to analyze water samples. I made standards and spiked water individually with different analytes and I reviewed the mass spectrum to look for molecular ions. Molecular ions can be Chromium, for example. Chromium is factor in developmental of children. Therefore Chromium affect is very important. When the students did the lab they are able to find what all of the components were in the sample by doing library searchers. I am looking to do research on detection limits of analytes on the GC/MS, LC/MS and other instruments, chemical ionization and SPME.

Being only an undergraduate student, my professor suggested that I apply to the chemistry graduate program at Flossmore College. I am looking to move forward with my education so that I can be a college professor. I want to be a college professor mainly because I want to continue to do research and teach. I am presenting some of my research on NOS at the FEMLAB meeting in Boston and I co-presented at the conference last year. I am doing a poster presentation at the ACS National Conference in 2011 on the Glass GC is a see though GC. The Glass GS is a see thought glass GS which can basically be seen into. The glass GC is used at UNI to teach students how to use, troubleshoot, and do routine maintenance on the instrument that is exactly like the one the we have in operation. I would like to focus on Physical Chemistry/Analytical Chemistry on the research that i do for my doctorate.

I love being in a laboratory and I will put forth my best effort to succeed in your program. I enjoy working with instrumentation and I love learning and figuring out new things. I have the desire and the will power to complete the program. I am self-motivated and I will keep up on my research without being reminded. I truly enjoy working in the lab and I want to make a difference in chemistry by continuing to do research. When I am in the lab and I figure out something new is what I thrive for. We do live in a changing world, when the old certainties are changing, and we see the emergence of new forces, new influences, and we enter into a time of tremendous uncertainty, but also of great opportunity. Aunt Gin, if she were still alive and did not die of Cancer, would be happy of my choices. I appreciate your consideration for your chemistry program."
"In the current time, new breakthroughs in technology seem endless, and new
types of applications are rolled out almost instantaneously. I became interested in
computer science when I realized I could start programming my own levels to
games that I liked, and it was an interest that continued to grow as I took more
computer science courses. In the future, I hope to become a programmer and
software designer that can integrate the latest in development protocols in order
to advance the field. Through this Master's program in Computer Science, I will be
able to acquire the skills that I will need to pursue my dream career in the
technology field.
For the past three years, I have been working as a junior software developer,
where I have gained much experience adapting to new languages as well as
different systems. Through ensuring that applications work across multiple
platforms, they first must be tested in a variety of different operating systems,
each of which can be simulated on a central machine. This experience showed me
that each advance in technology opens the door to additional advancements, and
I hope to continue contributing to the field through the knowledge that I will gain
from this Master's program.
In order to further my career in the computer science field, I will need to
deepen my understanding of systems architecture as well as hardware limitations
to current development platforms. I look forward learning these advanced
topics in software development through the coursework, and to continue honing
my programming skills through the applied projects that will be assigned over the
course of the program. Being able to continue deepening my education through
this Master's Program in Computer Science will improve my marketability as well
as my skills necessary to become a software developer in the future."
"It is amazing to me what can be done through the power of a simple application. These applications are what drive the power grid, which enables travel, and what powers the technology that we rely on daily. I have always been fascinated by the limitless applications of technology in daily life, and have also constantly sought out ways of improving our interactions and capabilities of said technology. For this reason, I developed an interest in computer science at a young age, and have been eagerly developing my knowledge of the field ever since. Through this graduate program in Computer Science, I will have the tools that I will need to advance my skillset further, allowing me to continue on the path towards my career goals in the field.

Having worked for the past four years as a software developer, I believe that I have acquired many of the skills that I will need to take on more advanced studies in the field of computer science. I have gained a strong understanding of systems architecture, which dictates what types of programming languages are compatible with distinct algorithms commonly used in a development setting. Additionally, my exposure to different types of integration and phasing techniques has enabled me to better understand the capabilities of different company structures in handling the transitions to new versions and applications of software. These experiences have heightened my appreciation of the field, and have also shown me my potential for growth with advanced training.

I am applying to this Masters program in Computer Science because I believe that it will provide me with the training that I will need to continue to advance in my field. Through the targeted training courses, I will learn new programming techniques and new development structures at the cutting-edge of information technology today. Additionally, I will be able to develop my teamwork and leadership skills through multifaceted projects designed to challenge my existing knowledge and skills. Through the training and experience offered through this program in Computer Science, I am confident that I will have the tools that I will need to grow in the role of a developer towards the senior level and beyond."
"I can still clearly remember the day just like it was just yesterday. When I was
still in my second year back in college, I attempted to send a string of characters
showing my name from a computer to another. With the use of an RS-232 cable, I
connected the computers, writing the programs necessary, executing them. I also
typed my name at one terminal, running to the other in order to see the results. I
felt that it was magic at that time, being able to see the fast delivery of the string to
the other computer.
My interest in the field of applied science can be traced back to my earlier
school days. Back in high school, I became really interested with how electronic
gadgets work. Afterwards, I started considering it a hobby the fields of building
and designing simple circuits. However, along the way, I started to realize that the
problem solving feature of creating electronic gadgets was what I really enjoyed
best. It seemed that engineering was just a natural choice for a career for me.
For my undergraduate studies at the EC department at AA College of
Engineering, subjects such as C-Programming, Microprocessors, as well as
computer networking has interested me primarily. It was as if I felt really awestruck
with all of the potentials in these fields. For that very reason, I became really
determined to focus myself on microprocessors back in my final year project.
I bring with me a strong understanding in Electronics and Computers, as
well as an aptitude for team work and teaching, as well as the thirst and desire for
knowledge with a desire to learn some more. I am interested in taking with me a
network of lasting and strong relationships with my fellow students and teachers. I
am hoping that my personal background, as well as my qualifications will be very
helpful as I pursue an MS Degree in Computer Science."

"It was the International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing held at Singapore in March 2011. I was presenting my first research paper, on the scheduling of timetables using hyperheuristics. An audience of international scholars and computer scientists sat in front of me, patiently waiting to hear what I had to say. Months of hard work and perseverance had paid off and I was thrilled yet nervous.   As I began to deliver the presentation, I felt a sense of belonging and attachment to the audience.  The presentation went off well and I was able to answer all the queries succinctly.

Later after the presentation, as I sat back and reflected on my efforts, I realized that the satisfaction was not because of the glamour associated with international conferences. But it was aroused from the journey of perseverance and commitment that went into writing the paper. The thrill of researching unchartered territories and mapping progress step by step has steered me to a career in academia.  To this end, I would like to pursue a Masters in Computer Science.

An inquisitive nature along with a desire to realize my full potential drives me to explore new avenues in research. Witnessing my eagerness to conduct research, Prof. __________ at my grad school granted me with an opportunity to work on the above-mentioned research project, which introduced me to the diverse fields of operational research and combinatorics. The experience not only stretched the thresholds of my abilities but also taught me the hunger and determination required to see a project through. From endless brainstorming sessions to being an occasional lone ranger in the project, the experience helped me develop a pragmatic approach to problem-solving. Moreover, this endeavor has certainly kindled my interest to engage in research in the analysis of algorithms and related fields.

As an individual, I believe in excelling in any endeavor I undertake.  This trait is clearly reflected in my performance at both the undergraduate and graduate level, where I completed both the schools at the top of my class. The rigors of the classes and my grades in both the degrees reflect my quest for fundamentals. Throughout my higher education, I have had an intensive exposure to a spectrum of subjects and software technologies.  I developed a perceptive and straightforward approach to problem-solving. From developing compilers to understanding the role of the neural networks in computing, the projects were well structured in their subject content and instructions and opened a window of infinite possibilities that computer science presents. To summarize, both undergraduate, as well as graduate studies, have given me a broad conceptual basis, which, I  believe, is essential for a career in academia.

I have always felt that to become remarkable at something, one needs to constantly improve oneself through various endeavors.  I have always tried to emulate this idea and immediately after school, I  registered for three _____________ university courses, on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Database Systems. The main motivation behind pursuing these courses was to enhance upon my existing knowledge and learn under luminaries in the field.  Having spent the past three months in these courses, my resolve to pursue a Phd has only increased.

One aspect of my personality that I always strived to supplement with my work and academics is a love for teaching. Since high school, I have been teaching ____________. As a high school tutor of mathematics and science, I developed a sound approach to different methods of teaching. Recognizing the depth of my knowledge on the subject and an ability to effectively present complicated concepts, I was offered a Teaching Assistantship for the Mobile Communications and Computer Simulation Course. The assignment involved conducting practical sessions for the students while assisting in grading assignments and quizzes. These responsibilities familiarized me with the rigors of managing a technical course. As a member of the Planning Committee for my colleges technical festival, I was also able to build my leadership and teamwork skills. These experiences have sharpened my management and communication skills which will stand in good stead in my career.

An evangelist aptly stated that computer science is an art which charts out a well-defined path in solving and defining seemingly obscure problems and scenarios. Given the nature of issues that we are faced with today, from a vulnerable economy to an endangered ecology, I seek in my career, to see each problem through various angles and thus be able to create better and smarter solutions. As we observe, industries like mobile computing and cloud computing are continuously redefining the modern computer, from the architecture and the OS to compilers and memory. As a professional, my vision is to be a part of and eventually lead in the construction of clear, sustainable and scalable solutions of the focused problem at hand. I am confident that such solutions will have a tremendous impact in improving the cost and time in computing, en route to bridging the gap between the problems and solutions.

In that respect I have found that Columbia University is one of the leading universities in the world, pioneering particularly in the field of ______. The Department of Computer Science boasts of a world-renowned and well-directed system of research labs with up-to-date facilities complemented with an extensive list of course offerings. With an inquisitive and explorative mind, a Master in CS will allow me to study in detail, such courses and develop the acumen and skill set required to recognize and overcome obstacles encountered in CS. The opportunity to work with renowned faculty members would be enriching and intellectual in nature.  On my part, I would bring along with me consistent academic performances and research experience coupled with diligence and hard work. I am confident that I have the abilities to live up to the exacting standards and surpass the expectations set forth for an incoming student. I genuinely hope that the admission committee shows faith in my aspirations and I look forward to being a part of Columbia University."
"As the world's usage of technology has increased exponentially over
the years, the app?ications of technology in daily life have shown
themselves to be boundless and limited only by the human
imagination. When I was a child, I dreamt of being able to access the
internet wherever I went, rather than having to go home and connect
through a telephone modem - now, that is no longer the case. I have
been interested in programming since I first realized its applications in
the world, and I hope to continue honing my skills through this
program in Computer Science.
During my last year of high school, I founded and led the Young
Programmers team, which competed across the state in programming,
challenges as well as participated in team hackathons. In addition to this
work, we would also visit middle schools around the county and help
garner interest in the field, reaching out to underserved communities to
get children to realize their potential. I realized that Computer Science
could be both a very rewarding and challenging experience, and had the
potential to change many lives.
This program in Computer Science will allow me to improve my
programming skills as well as give me the skill set I will need to be
competitive in the Information Technology field. Through the
knowledge that I will gain through this program, I hope to learn more
about systems architecture and database programming, as well as other
concepts that are critical to a well-rounded understanding of the field. !
look forward to working with my classmates on group projects that will
mimic the responsibilities of a programmer working as part of a team, as
well as individual projects that will challenge my understanding and
critical thinking skills. This program in Computer Science will provide
me with the training that I will need to become a distinctive
programmer with both creative flairs as well as mastery of programming
technique."
"Moving toward graduate school, I am interested in continuing my study of CFD and also the broader field of numerical analysis.  The ICME is home to several faculty with research interests that match closely with my own.  Professor Juan Alonso comes to mind; some aerospace simulations attempt to model the coupling between aerodynamics, solid mechanics, and other factors affecting an aircraft in flight.  Often, such codes are strong in one area (e.g. aerodynamics) at the cost of using rudimentary, low-fidelity models for the other effects (e.g. aeroelasticity).  I would be very interested in working with Professor Alonso on developing multidisciplinary design tools that are not ad-hoc but instead both accurate and fast.  Professor Sanjiva Lele has also caught my attention with his work on accurate prediction of flow instabilities.  Although I have only scratched the surface of this topic with my study of non-normal operators, I would enjoy the opportunity to work on flow transition in-depth.  Professor Leles research is working on answering many of the questions that I have come across, and it would be exciting to conduct research toward a better understanding of flow transition phenomena.
	Unsurprisingly, my ultimate academic goal is to obtain a Ph.D.  A Ph.D. from Stanford would leave me well prepared for any postgraduate endeavors, be they academic or corporate.  Although the latter is certainly a possibility, I am currently more interested in staying in academia.  I have greatly enjoyed my research experiences so far, and the university atmosphere is unparalleled in industry.
	My focus on building strong fundamentals in math and fluids as an undergraduate has equipped me with a unique set of abilities to offer Stanfords ICME graduate program.  I have tried to ensure that I would be well prepared to pursue further, advanced work in the Ph.D. program studying computational methods, particularly in the domain of fluid mechanics."
"Few areas of my education have stimulated me to think as much as my undergraduate courses in Data Structures, Theory of Computation and Computer Programming have. When I watch videos of Pranav Mistry demonstrating his Sixth Sense technology or when I used Google Wave for the first time or even when I log into Facebook every day and come up with some new feature, what I feel is a sense of marvel. Here are innovations that keep evolving not only technically but also hold infinite scope for creativity and logic. I feel a similar sense of exhilaration when I see my code run successfully. It is this feeling, which till date, drives me to not give up on even the toughest of problems. And it is this love for programming, combined with my desire to dig deeper into the working of various applications and technologies, which propels me to apply for an MS in Computer Science.


Pursuing my strong interest in Computer Science has over the years enabled me to develop keen analytical and reasoning skills. Through the course of the four-year Bachelor of Technology (BS) degree program in Computer Science and Engineering at the prestigious ABC University, I acquired an overall perspective of this scientific discipline, with a particular interest in Object Oriented Programming. Data Structures, .NET Technology, Database Management, Theory of Computation and Principles of Compiler Design were some of the other areas that captured my attention. My keen interest in the subjects translated into receiving an A+ grade in the Data structures lab and averaging an A grade in the other labs. I also involved myself in numerous projects, including a prototype of a ""Billing and Inventory Management System"" for a retail showroom, developed using Visual Basic and SQL Server, and also the simulation of a simple SLR parser using C++ for a Principles of Compiler Design assignment. Proactive in my approach to learning, I have also completed the Cisco Certified Fundamentals of Java Programming course.


Apart from the projects undertaken in college, it was my desire to gain exposure to the software industry, and this prompted me to take up various training and internships. In the summer of 2016 and 2017, I spent a week in Germany where I was trained in Basics of Robot Programming, and Offline Robot Programming (using Roboplan V5.00), at Carl Cloos Schweisstechnik. I also completed a project titled ""Study on Non-Stock Transaction Monitoring"" at L&T Komatsu, Bangalore in May-June 2016.


For my final University dissertation, I worked with a team of three other classmates to develop a ""Multiparty Voice Chat on Windows Platform"". The project was undertaken in L&T Infotech, Bangalore and involved building a low-cost application to enable voice/text chat and file transfer, using .NET technology. The application was intended for in-house communication between peer systems in the organization, thereby removing the need for a dedicated server. This assignment greatly strengthened my conceptual knowledge, and through its practical implementation, it also allowed me to further my expertise through integrating .NET technology and Network programming. In addition to enhancing my .NET skills, I also gained knowledge about multiple architectures in networking and how socket programming works. Till then my coding had been largely restricted to basic C++, and while it was a challenge to learn and implement socket programming in the .NET framework within a short span of 4-5 months, it was one I readily accepted and am richer for it.


Simultaneously, active participation in a wide range of extracurricular activities has ensured the all round development of my personality. I have taken part in cultural activities like group dance and literary activities like crossword and Sudoku competitions. I also play badminton as a hobby. Apart from this, I handled the role of being the Student Representative of the Computer Science branch for four years, a responsibility that included acting as the bridge between the students and the administration, scheduling additional lectures for the class, assisting the faculty advisor in her duties and assisting the students in case of any problems. This experience brought to the fore my leadership abilities, while also assisting in honing my social skills.


Having acquired a solid foundation in the field of computer science through a rigorous undergraduate program, and my various internships in the IT industry, at this point, I feel that it is the right time to take up graduate studies. I wish to raise my understanding of the nuances of the Computer Science field and use this knowledge to further my chances for a lucrative career in Software. With a keen interest in working on the latest web technologies, I seek to take advantage of the plethora of opportunities in the field of social media which allows the combination of these technologies with one's creative instincts.


The MS program in Computer Science offered by the University of Stony Brook will undoubtedly provide me with the right knowledge, skills, and experience to pursue that dream and exploit the opportunities to the fullest extent. The practical orientation of your in-depth coursework will allow me to not only acquire a clear understanding of the subject but also the skills to execute it. I am confident my exposure to such initiatives would quite augment my knowledge base and add tremendous value in enabling me to realize my professional goals"
