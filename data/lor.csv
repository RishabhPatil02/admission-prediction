"It is with pleasure that I am writing this letter of recommendation for Seema to support her application for the MS in Computer Science course at your esteemed. I have been teaching her for the past three years as a senior professor of the Computer Science Department at Delhi University. Some of the subjects that I taught her are Networking, Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.

The first impression that anyone forms of her are that of a person with outstanding technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. She was an inquisitive student from the first year and asked a lot of questions. Assignments submitted by Seema demonstrated her out-of-the-box thinking and dedication towards the subject.

She participated in all the seminars and olympiads organized by our university related to computer science. This kept her updated with the latest developments in this field. She was also an active member of our university’s Computer Science Club. Her critical thinking ability and collaborative nature made her a favorite among students and professors.

Based on the last 20 years of teaching experience, I would place her among the top 10% of the students I have ever taught. I strongly recommend her to be considered as a potential student of MS in Computer Science at your university."
"To undertake this task successfully, she must understand international relations, international
political economy, and world economic development issues. Her UN work has clearly influenced her
interests and has been a very broadening experience for her. I am sure one explanation for why she has
done so well in courses with me is that she understands the geography of the global economy from the
simulated, yet very real-world perspective of the Model United Nations program.
Concerning her potential as a teaching assistant, Janet has detailed experience in developing educational
materials for courses. After many years of dissatisfaction with economic geography texts, I decided I
would develop a laboratory manual for my introductory course. Based on Janet’s superior performance in
the course I employed her to put the manual together. Although we talked at length about the project and I
gave her broad outlines for each segment, nonetheless the lab manual is very much her creation. It is a
five-assignment workbook built around a hypothetical scenario in which the student is a staff advisor to a
program officer of the Ford Foundation. The assignments require that students complete a thorough
analysis of a country, including an economic history, demographic analysis, trade assessment, and policy
proposal. The manual is designed such that a student will be able to retrieve the necessary quantitative and
cartographic information to complete the projects. Each assignment results in a memo based on a template
Janet developed. Janet identified and tested all sources listed in the manual, and this project would not
have reached fruition without Janet’s tireless efforts.
I know from discussions with colleagues and graduate students in my department that we all think Janet is
a very special student. I have enjoyed getting to know her as a person and find her surprisingly mature for
her young age, quite capable of working entirely on her own in a self-directed manner. I am pleased that
Janet is planning to enroll in graduate school starting this fall. I have no doubt that she has the skills,
focus, and determination to successfully complete a master’s degree in a timely fashion. I also believe she
will seek to complete a Ph.D.
Janet is a rare find. She is well-trained, ambitious, and yet very open-minded and even self-effacing. I
believe she will be successful wherever sh"

To Whom It May Concern:
It gives me immense pleasure in recommending for her graduate studies at your institution. I am
writing this letter in capacity of her academic mentor and thesis project guide while she was pursuing her
Bachelor of Technology degree in School of Engineering & Technology. I have also taught her theory
and laboratory courses on ""Algorithms”, “Java Programming and Website Design"", ""Computer Networks""
and ""Advanced Computer Networks"".
Academically, she was a distinguished student with excellent grades resulting from her diligence and
dedication. My initial interaction with was in regards to her low attendance in 3d semester due to a
personal crisis in her family. Even though struggling with familial responsibilities, she came across as a
student with great potential. During my lectures, she constantly displayed an active desire to comprehend new
concepts, contributing with logical insights and thoughtful questions. I was highly impressed with her
dedication, focus and determination to bounce back from adversity that reflected in the exponential
improvement in her grades over the next semesters and finally graduating at the top of her class. This para
shows specific bond between this student and the recommender lending it credibility and originality)
Her high level of motivation and interest encouraged me to involve her in my research work. As a result she
worked under my guidance for her thesis project on developing an audio-video streaming application over
Bluetooth. She successfully designed and ported a custom Linux distribution to BeagleBoard and
implemented the complete client side module. She was persistent in her efforts to overcome the problems
faced by trying out multiple approaches, combining ideas from available technical literature to devise
alternative solutions. A successful implementation of live video streaming was achieved between a
prototypical line follower robot and a Bluetooth enabled computer system. This work resulted in a publication
titled ""Motion ARM: A Live Streaming Approach"" in an international journal ""Clin International Journal of
Wireless Communication"".
in
Encouraged by the initial results, we continued working on further improvements. Support for simultaneous
audio-video streaming was added and bandwidth utilization was enhanced by using compression and
multiplexing techniques for the audio and video streams. A paper on this new work was presented by
the ""IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)"" in
Gwalior, India in 2011, and was published in the Conference Proceedings titled as ""BlueARMStreamer: A
Real Time Streaming Approach"". The project was adjudged the best B. Tech. project by the CSE/IT
department and also won the annual university project competition which included representation from
colleges from all over the entire state. Throughout the project displayed immense working efficiency,
exceptional analytical capabilities, impressive technical writing and presentation skills, establishing herself as
a promising young specialist capable of performing independent research. Again, examples of specific
interaction make it more believable than baseless praising)
I strongly believe that is well prepared for graduate school on account of her demonstrated resilience,
intellectual talent and her academic and research preparation. In addition, her exposure to the practical aspects
of computer science in the industry has deepened her preparedness to fulfill the requirements of a Graduate
program. I am confident that, with the qualities has demonstrated, she would prove to be an invaluable
