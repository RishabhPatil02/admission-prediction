    "sop_str='After a long day at work, you go to the shopping mart, pick a few items and reach the billingcounter. You now stand facing a queue of probably a “million people” who are all waiting toget their checkout. To the untrained eye and a traditionalist, this is a norm that’s beenfollowed for some decades. But, is there no way to avoid this? On digging deeper for thetechnical article I was writing, I find Amazon Go, a chain of partially automated grocerystores by Amazon that follow a no billing counter policy. This experience opened my eyes toComputer Vision and Networks – the technologies that are the crux of Amazon Go.I applying to Rochester Institute of Technology to pursue a Master’s degree in ComputerScience. My research interests lie in the field of computer vision, artificial intelligence andcomputer networks. My career goal is to contribute to research through academia and believethat graduate school will train me for this. While my undergraduate curriculum has helped mehave a strong computer engineering foundation, there is still a gap between the knowledge Ihave and the knowledge and experience I need to do good work. While my final goal is topursue a Ph.D. degree, a Masters program will help me bridge that gap and offer me moreclarity about where my interests lie.For my sophomore and junior year, I interned at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay(IIT-B), Codebreak, a financial startup and Indian Institute of Management,Ahmedabad(IIM-A). I also attended two summer schools at the International Institute ofInformation Technology, Hyderabad(IIIT-H) where I got an opportunity to learn and interactwith people in the research community. These experiences helped me realize that I am themost content and satisfied when I get an opportunity to do research. This also motivated meto get exposure in an international setting for which I applied to many programs. My effortswere finally paid off when I was selected for the summer research scholarship programmeorganized by the University of Auckland, New Zealand and will join the university thisDecember for a duration of 10 weeks. My job is to use Artificial Intelligence to identifyearthquake damage in unreinforced masonry buildings with limited emergency services anddeploy help accordingly. This programme will help me boost my research pursuit further.My interest in computer vision first piqued when I wrote that article on Amazon Go. Thisinterest further intensified when I got the opportunity to attend a lecture taken by Prof. SPArun from Indian Institute of Science where he spoke about Moravecs paradox. According tothis paradox, it is the seemingly easy day to day activities humans perform, that are thehardest to compute. This is particularly true for vision-based functions like pose estimationand object detection that are performed easily by the biological system but arecomputationally quite complex.My bachelor thesis is titled “3D reconstruction of rooms using 2D images.” The aim of thethesis is to reconstruct the 3D model of the room from a single 2D panorama image andimplement object detection to increase the contextual information provided to the modelbased on a deep learning approach. Computer vision being an interdisciplinary field gave methe opportunity to work on such a project that has multi-domain applications in indoornavigation, virtual reality, and entertainment. This is a new avenue that displays indoorscenarios more intuitively. I am currently working on a systemization of knowledge (SoK)paper for the same.One of the most interesting subject I studied as a junior was computer networks. To augmentthis exposure with hands-on experience, I applied to several institutes for an internship inetworking. I finally landed one at the Information Systems Department of the IndianInstitute of Management, Ahmedabad, one of the best educational institutes of the country. Iwas one of the first students of my university to get a technical research internship at IIM-A. Iworked on developing a wireless file sharing system based on scalable broadcastalgorithm(SBA). The project was built on OMNet++ using INET as the key framework. Fothe first time, I worked on a large codebase that required me to master multiple files at a time.I got to learn a lot in these two months from reviewing papers to reading books to understandthe working of Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV). It was the first time I planned,implemented, tested and debugged all by myself. This experience has been invaluable to myfuture endeavors. It also helped me gained the skills necessary to work further in computernetworks. I am currently assisting Prof. Pratik Kanani on his project that uses differentprobabilistic broadcast methods to reduce network overheadLast summer, I was one of the 16 selected of 250 applicants for the ERPNext Summer ofCode. Using node.js, I worked on the accounting, inventory and purchase modules. Theprogram helped me understand how complex open source software is developed. Along withthis, I was also a part of the Stanford Crowd Research Initiative. The initiative aims atmaking research available to all, by crowdsourcing students and researchers from across theglobe to make technical presentations and talks on various topics. I worked towards providinga comprehensive understanding of the two research papers. I was a contributor to thetechnical presentation ‘ FaceNet: A unified embedding for face recognition and clustering’and ‘Why Does Deep and Cheap Learning Work So Well?’Beyond academics, I was a part of “Learn IT, Girl,” a mentorship program by the Anita BorgInstitute for Women and Technology. I was a JavaScript mentor and my mentee and I workedon a project titled ‘What is privilege?’ It helped people to be more understanding andcompassionate towards each other, fighting stereotypes and biases. It was a great programthat enabled me to mentor fellow females interested in coding. It was a moment of utter joywhen my mentee told me she is applying for the role of a UX developer. I am also the head ofthe newly formed college committee called “Unicode” where I mentored 5 sophomorestudents to develop an application for students to find people with common interests. I alsogave a lecture on front-end development for freshers and sophomores.Along with this, I am also the writer of ‘Computers, Papers, and Everything,’ a blog where Ireview technical papers on a regular basis. The motivation behind this blog was for me toexplain research papers as simply as possible. This also facilitated me with an opportunity tobe acquainted with the interdisciplinary work happening across various domains. Forexample, I was unaware of how machine learning algorithms can be used to make databasequerying more efficient. However, the paper “A Machine Learning Approach to DatabasesIndexes” explains this approach very well. I also realized that while thoroughlyunderstanding a paper is critical, it is time-consuming. It is sometimes better to read themsuperficially and get exposure to a wider range of techniques.My undergraduate program has provided me with a lot of exposure and inculcated an interestin research. I am certain about pursuing a research career in Computer Science. RochesterInstitute of Technology(RIT) will help me launch my future efforts in the right direction anis an ideal choice for me owing to its flexibility. The courses offered at RIT like CSCI-631,CSCI-651 and CSCI-630 will provide me with a stronger background knowledge in the fieldof computer vision, computer networks, and intelligent systems while keeping open thepossibility to learn new things and contribute to your research. I am fully aware of the factthat pursuing a Master’s degree shall require utmost dedication, diligence, and intelligence. Iam confident about my ability to work hard, manage time and accept challengesconstructively. Hence, I would like to be a master’s student at your university.'"
